  observations:
    derived_remarks:
      egfrcr: NKF KDOQI and KDIGO guidelines recommend confirming an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45–59 mL/min/1.73m² with a urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR) &lt;30 mg/g based on an eGFR calculated using both creatinine and cystatin C.
      psa_r: |
        When Total PSA is in the range of 4.0–10.0 ng/mL, a Free PSA/Total PSA ratio of %{psa_r} indicates a %{risk} risk of prostate cancer.
        Test results cannot be interpreted as absolute evidence for the presence or absence of malignant disease.
